# ✈️ Aircraft Damage Classification (Crack vs Dent) & 🖼️ Image Caption Generation  

This repository contains my **Final Project** for the course:  
**“Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras”**  

The project has **two major components**:  

1. **Aircraft Damage Classification** – A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **Transfer Learning (VGG16)** to classify aircraft damages into **Cracks vs. Dents**.  
2. **Image Caption Generation** – Using **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining)** to generate meaningful captions for unseen images.

## 📌 Project Overview  

- ✅ Built and trained a CNN for **aircraft damage classification** with **>81% test accuracy**.  
- ✅ Classified **type of damage (Crack / Dent)** instead of just binary damaged vs. normal.  
- ✅ Applied **Transfer Learning (VGG16)** with **data augmentation** and **callbacks** (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau).  
- ✅ Implemented **BLIP** for **image captioning** that generates human-like captions.  
- ✅ Explored both **computer vision (classification)** and **vision-language (captioning)** tasks in one project.

## 🚀 Results  

### Aircraft Damage Classification (Crack vs Dent)  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~85%  
- **Test Accuracy:** ~81%  
- **Model Used:** VGG16 (frozen base + fine-tuned dense layers)    

📊 Example:  

| Image | Prediction |
|-------|------------|
| ![crack](https://www.rpxtech.com/uploads/9/3/3/2/93321990/an-2-fatigue-crack.jpeg) | Crack |
| ![dent](https://scientificconceptsartandlife.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/unnamed-1.jpg)   | Dent |


### Image Caption Generation (BLIP)  

BLIP generates captions for unseen images:  

- Input: 🖼️ *Aircraft flying in cloudy sky*  
- Output: **"an airplane flying through the clouds"**  

- Input: 🖼️ *Damaged aircraft*  
- Output: **"a damaged airplane parked on the runway"**
