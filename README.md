# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Damage Detection & üñºÔ∏è Image Caption Generation  

This repository contains my **Final Project** for the course:  
**‚ÄúIntroduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras‚Äù**  

The project has **two major components**:  

1. **Aircraft Damage Detection** ‚Äì A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **Transfer Learning (VGG16)** to classify damaged vs. non-damaged aircraft images.  
2. **Image Caption Generation** ‚Äì Using **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining)** to generate meaningful captions for images.

## üìå Project Overview  

- ‚úÖ Built and trained a CNN for **aircraft damage classification** with **>81% test accuracy**.  
- ‚úÖ Applied **Transfer Learning (VGG16)** with **data augmentation** and **callbacks** (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau).  
- ‚úÖ Implemented **BLIP** for **image captioning** that generates human-like captions.  
- ‚úÖ Explored both **computer vision (classification)** and **vision-language (captioning)** tasks in one project.
